discord Spotify integration (that's what the aim is).

Currently searches for the artist, album, song from spotify can copies the neccesary link to your clipboard, where you can paste it. 

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --artist ARTIST  select artist
  --album ALBUM    select album
  --song SONG      select song
  --clone CLONE    no. of similar album(s)
  --os OS          what os using
```

#### Help needed :

Discord does not allow for bot-bot communication. The messages sent from terminal using discord.py or using your own client serves as a bot. Hence the music bot such as hydra or freedboat does not recognize the commands sent in the channel. 

Any ideas on other backtrack options is appreciated. 

:)
